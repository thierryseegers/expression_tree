\section introduction Introduction

An expression tree is a tree that stores data in its leaf nodes and operations in its branch nodes.
The tree's value can then be obtained by performing a preorder traversal, recursively applying the branch nodes's operations to their children.

For example, his tree evaluates to (2 * 1 + (2 - \a x)):

\code
(2 * l + r)
 /       \
1      (l - r)
        /   \
      2      x
\endcode

\section considerations Technical considerations

This implementation:
 - is contained in a single header file.
 - is templatized.
 - specializes the branches and the leaves to reduce space overhead.
 - is dependent on C++0x's function<> class.
 - requires RTTI.
 - has little in the way of safety checks.
 - has been tested with g++ 4.2.1, VS 2008 and VS2010.
   Later versions of g++ probably do not require the extra header inclusion (may not hurt) or the std::tr1 macro (may hurt).

In order to be evaluated, the expression_tree must be correctly formed.
That is, all its branch nodes' children nodes must have been given a value.

\section pre-evaluating Pre-evaluating optimization

By instantiating an epxression_tree with its second template parameter set to \c true, 
evaluation will be optimzed by pre-evaluating a branch's value if all it childrens (branches or leaves) are constant.

For example:

\code
  B1
 /  \
C1  B2
   /  \
  C2  C3
\endcode

If this tree is built in the following order: B1, C1, B2, C2, C3, upon assignment of C3, B2 will be found to be of constant value and be pre-evaluated.
This pre-evaluation will continue recursively up the tree for as long as a branch's both children are constant.
In this case, B1 will also be pre-evaluated.

If C1 had instead been a variable (e.g. \a x), only B2 will have been pre-evaluated.
B1, not having both its children constant, will be evaluated when expression_tree::evaluate() is called.

\subsection degenerate Degenerate case

Given the following tree:

\code
  B1
 /  \
C1  B2
   /  \
  C2  B3
     /  \
    C3   B4
        / .
       C4  .
            .
            Bn
           /  \
          Cn  Cn+1
\endcode

Before C<SUB>n+1</SUB> is assigned to, none of the tree has been pre-evaluated, given that none of its nodes' constness can be confirmed.
When C<SUB>n+1</SUB> is assigned to, B<SUB>n</SUB> will be found constant and be evaluated.
B<SUB>n-1</SUB> will also be found constant and be evaluated.
This will continue until entire tree is evaluated.
Thus, a single assignment can trigger the equivalent of expression_tree::evaluate().

\section improvements Future improvements

 - Allow assignment of an entire tree to a node.

\section sample Sample code

\code
#include "expression_tree.h"

#include <iostream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    // Create an int tree that will not pre-evaluate.
    expression_tree<int, false> etif;

    //        3

    etif.root() = 3;

    cout << etif.evaluate() << endl; // Prints "3".


    //  (2 * l + r)
    //   /       \
    //  1      (l - r)
    //          /   \
    //        2      3

    etif.root() = [](int i, int j){ return 2 * i + j; }; // Re-assigns root node from leaf to branch.
    etif.root().left() = 1;
    etif.root().right() = minus<int>();
    etif.root().right().left() = 2;
    etif.root().right().right() = 3;

    cout << etif.evaluate() << endl; // Prints "1" (2 * 1 + (2 - 3)).

    // Re-evaluate the tree.
    // Because it is a non-pre-evaluating tree, all nodes will be re-visited and all operations re-applied.
    cout << etif.evaluate() << endl;

    // Assign a variable to the rightmost leaf.
    int x = 1;
    etif.root().right().right() = &x;
	
    cout << etif.evaluate() << endl; // Prints "3" (2 * 1 + (2 - 1)).

    // Change the value of that variable and re-evaluate.
    x = 2;

    cout << etif.evaluate() << endl; // Prints "2" (2 * 1 + (2 - 2)).


    // Create a string tree that will pre-evaluate.
    expression_tree<string, true> etst;
    
    //    (l + r)
    //  /         \
    // s        (l + r)
    //           /   \
    //         " "  "tree"

    string s = "expression";

    etst.root() = plus<string>();
    etst.root().left() = &s;
    etst.root().right() = plus<string>();
    etst.root().right().left() = string(" ");
    etst.root().right().right() = string("tree");

    cout << etst.evaluate() << endl; // Prints "expression tree".

    // Change the value of variable s and re-evaluate.
    // Because this is a pre-evaluating tree, constant branches will not be re-evaluated.
    // For this tree, it means the concatenation of " " and "tree" will not be performed again.
    s = "apple";

    cout << etst.evaluate() << endl; // Prints "apple tree".

    
    // Misues.

    expression_tree<float, true> crash;
    //crash.evaluate(); // The tree is empty.

    crash.root() = divides<float>();
    //crash.evaluate(); // This tree cannot be evaluated, its root node is an operation with no data children to operate on.

    crash.root() = 2.;
    //crash.root().left() = divides<float>(); // Assigning to a data node's children is undefined behavior.

    return 0;
}
\endcode
